        <p class="about-it">
         Well this journeying project as the name suggests is a platform that
         holds written podcast of people in the tech field and the ways they
         have had to follow or the path they have chosen to lead them to be where
         they are. My main goal was to build a platform where people that are newly
         embarking in the tech world could get a place where they can get blog to get
         inspirations and leads. Trello project management tool came in handy mainly in
         how I managed my tasks and scheduled each task to accomplish at a particular time.
